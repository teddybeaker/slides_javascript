Please note that these samples are structured to make a training/workshop 
easier and reproduce bugs one is likely to encounter. They are by no means to 
be considered clean code.

clean code would require at least the following:
- putting styles and javascript code into separate files
- using a namespaces instead of packing everything into global namespace

Also, the solutions might not be the best approach to solve the task of the 
respective issue but show one way of fixing what went wrong.
