Problem:
- some expensive calculation is started before all DOM (especially the image) is loaded

Solution:
- attach calculation expensive stuff to window.onload so it will be executed after the whole page has rendered (see indexSolutionShouldWork.html)
  this should actually work but obviously doesn't for some reason I haven't figured out yet
- delegate calculation to web worker (see indexSolutionWebWorker.html). Thanks to Patrick. Note that Chrome will have the same security concerns than in issue3; view in Firefox or deploy server

Workaround (indexWorkaroundTimeout.html):
- start the calculation after some delay so the browser has time to finish rendering the image
