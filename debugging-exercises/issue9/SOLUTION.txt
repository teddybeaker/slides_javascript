Problem:
- Developer forgot to include a required JS-files (jQuery and jquery-ui)
- giveaways for what is missing are:
	- $ not found -> jQuery
	- "datepicker" not found: search for "jQuery datepicker" and download the respective library (jquery-ui)
	- for both libraries, try newest version, if they don't work, try with older ones.

Solution:
- add missing file includes
